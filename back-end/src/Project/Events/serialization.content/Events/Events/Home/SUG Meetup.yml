        Let&rsquo;s setup CI/CD for Sitecore Managed Cloud/PaaS using Azure DevOps pipelines.<br />
        <br />
        "Time is money. Especially you need to deploy Sitecore SXA + JSS solution to Azure either as Sitecore PaaS or Sitecore Managed Cloud.<br />
        In this session I will share how we configured the Azure DevOps CI/CD process in our project based on Sitecore SXA + JSS and delivered all stuff (.Net projects, JSS build, SXA modules, serialized items) to Sitecore Managed Cloud."<br />

        Semantic search with Sitecore Cortex<br />
        <br />
        "What`s the difference between syntactic search and semantic?<br />
        Semantic search denotes search with meaning, as distinguished from lexical search where the search engine looks for literal matches of the query words or variants of them, without understanding the overall meaning of the query. Semantic search systems consider various points including context of search, intent, variation of words, synonyms, generalized and specialized queries, concept matching and natural language queries to provide relevant search results.<br />
        To show capabilities of semantic search in Sitecore I prepared a demo that uses ML to find related items like news, articles, products etc based on NLP."<br />
